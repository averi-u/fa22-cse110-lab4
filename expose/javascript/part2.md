1. It prints out 3 since the prices arrays has a length 3. 
2. It prints out 150 since discounted was updated the last with 300*0.5=150. 
3. It prints out 150 sinces finalPrice was updated the last with 300*0.5=150. 
4. The function would return discounted array [50, 100, 150] because these are the three prices pushed to the array. 
5. The console returns an eror since let variable i cnanot be accessed outside the block for loop. 
6. The console returns an eror since discountedPrice is not defined. 
7. The console returns 150 since console.log calling is in the same block with the let variable. 
8. The function would return discounted array [ 50, 100, 150 ] because these are the three prices pushed to the array. 
9. The console returns an eror since const variable i cnanot be accessed outside the block for loop. 
10. The console returns 3 since console.log calling is in the same block with the let variable. 
11. The function would return discounted array [ 50, 100, 150 ] because these are the three prices pushed to the array.

    8.  NaN. 
14. A. true, B. false, C. true, JS would turn the string into numbers and then compare. 
    1.  D. false, E. false, F. true. The explanation for === and == is shown below. Moreover, JS recognizes Boolean(2) as true. 
15. The main difference between the == and === operator in javascript is that the == operator does the type conversion of the operands before comparison, whereas the === operator compares the values as well as the data types of the operands.
16.  
17. It outputs [ 2, 4, 6 ]. The function uses the callback variable inside the loop and it goes to doSomething function which multifies the number by 2 each time.
